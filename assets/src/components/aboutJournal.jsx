                                The Guild of Educators in TESOL International (GET International) is a scholarly, open-access, international, quarterly, 
                                peer-reviewed, online journal that publishes research articles that contribute to human and societal development through 
                                excellent academic and scientific findings. GET Internationalâ€™s interdisciplinary nature adheres to the global challenge 
                                for all educators and industry practitioners to value the integration of various disciplines in their studies in order to 
                                arrive at a holistic understanding of a phenomenon or an inquiry. Thus, while the journal accepts articles on knowledge from different disciplines (multidisciplinary), 
                                it gives high regard to studies that deal with knowledge within and across disciplines.
