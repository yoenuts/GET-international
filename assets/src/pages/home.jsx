                                        <strong>Sociology:</strong>  Sociology provides insights into social structures, institutions, and dynamics. Applying sociological perspectives to 
                                        TESOL allows educators to explore how language learning and teaching are influenced by social factors such as social class, gender, ethnicity, 
                                        and power relationships within the classroom and broader society.

                                        <strong>Global Studies/International Relations:</strong> TESOL has strong ties to global studies and international relations due to the nature of 
                                        language learning and the increasing global demand for English. An interdisciplinary approach with these fields allows educators to explore the 
                                        global spread of English, language policies, and the impact of English language proficiency on individuals, communities, and international interactions.

                                        <strong>Education Policy and Administration:</strong> TESOL intersects with education policy and administration as it involves decision-making processes, 
                                        curriculum development, and assessment practices. Understanding the policies and administrative frameworks that influence language education can inform 
                                        TESOL professionals in creating effective programs and advocating for the needs of English language learners.
